00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:07,950
hi everyone today I'm here to explain the success criterion 3.3.2 labels

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,480
or instructions this success criterion

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,170
it is part of the category understandable criteria that is the category

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,849
where the information and operations of the user interface must be

5
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:26,869
understandable the purpose of this criterion is to provide

6
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:31,910
labels or instructions when the content requires input actions by

7
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:39,320
of the user especially for the benefit of people with disabilities the techniques

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,610
I have used enough to satisfy this criterion are a few

9
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:49,040
the following the first we find the supply of descriptive labels

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,840
the goal of this technique is to have a clarifying label

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,420
the purpose of the component so for example we see here a section that we

12
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,809
depicts three fields in which we must enter the required data

13
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:12,869
to make it easier I inserted a label before each field that indicated

14
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:20,159
what was entered in that particular field same thing I did

15
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,560
for below and for below still in the date of birth I have also entered the format

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,509
day month and year, then we move to our right where

17
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:37,110
we are a more detailed and detailed description of what we owe

18
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,590
go and enter in the fields on our left

19
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,590
after this technique sufficient

20
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,640
we find another technique used of label elements to bind

21
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,470
text labels to form controls

22
00:01:54,470 --> 00:02:01,280
the goal of this technique is to use some

23
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:08,990
tags including the "label" tag with some "for" and "id" attributes

24
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,830
the "label" tag defines a label for some specific elements

25
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,520
poi troviamo un attributo cioè il "for" un attributo che specifica "id"

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:25,070
del modulo a cui deve essere associata l'etichetta

27
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,850
dopo questa tecnica troviamo la tecnica

28
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:33,230
un'altra tecnica fornire una descrizione per gruppi di controlli modulo

29
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:39,620
utilizzando gli elementi di "fieldset" e "legend" allora l'elemento "fieldset" è

30
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,930
utilizzato per raggruppare elementi correlati fra loro con un raggruppamento

31
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:50,680
semantico che poi in una tecnica successiva che andrò ad illustare dopo

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,160
troveremo proprio un raggruppamento semantico una tecnica che

33
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,880
necessita di questo raggruppamento quindi questo elemento "fieldset" serve

34
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:08,410
proprio per agevolarsi a fare questo raggruppamento di elementi

35
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:16,090
nella prossima tecnica sufficiente troviamo l'aggiunta

36
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,950
di un nome di gruppo al nome accessibile di un controllo modulo

37
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:25,690
then the goal of this technique is to provide semantic grouping with various

38
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:31,890
groups represented by a name in what sense

39
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:37,420
we must also do a semantic grouping here with

40
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,230
various boxes that group other sections

41
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,989
all these sections are represented by a name for example this is the first section that

42
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:54,650
groups three subsections we find personal data that we say represents

43
00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:00,409
all the first section within the first section we find others

44
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:04,879
subsections with a name that also represents them

45
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,310
for example the user to search represents this section

46
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:16,009
data to identify the user represents this data section to access this site

47
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:20,180
form to become a member of our gym this section represents

48
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:27,320
having said that we can also move on to the next sufficient technique

49
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,680
using an adjacent button to label the purpose of a

50
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,849
field in what sense the goal of this technique is that for

51
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:43,550
make it easier for the user to understand this is an operation in this research case

52
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:50,849
a button is positioned so that it is clear that a term must be entered

53
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:57,539
in this case the button is located on the right a button

54
00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:04,639
then a button to let the user understand that a

55
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:14,550
determined input to be searched also with the help of the label above

56
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,289
let's see another technique the technique

57
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:25,610
setting the "label" property for form components

58
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:33,320
the goal of this technique is to use the checkbox element ie

59
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:40,180
an element that is supported by the "label"

60
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,680
as said before the "label" it defines a label for some

61
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,810
specific elements and element checkbox let's go and see it causes us

62
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:58,509
check boxes for example enter your male or female gender

63
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:02,560
I am male and therefore I check the male box and allow us to

64
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,849
check this box,

65
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:14,410
checkbox also acts as a square container for the

66
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:23,949
our check, having said this, I have finished illustrating here

67
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:29,020
the techniques sufficient or at least most of the techniques sufficient

68
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:36,370
because of course there are many others having said that thanks for your attention and

69
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,210
goodbye
